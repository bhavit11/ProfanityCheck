# ProfanityCheck

A very basic python program that checks for profanity words in a text that is provided by the user and then alerts the user if there is any profanity word in the document.

How it works:
1) It asks the user for the location of the text file to be read
2) Opens the text file and pulls one word at a time and checks that word on a website called wdyl.com/profanity?="word".
3) The program alerts the user if there are any profanity words.
